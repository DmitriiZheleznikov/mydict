This is test text, it exists only for tests.
1. Read file into memory and convert it into a list of words
2. Filter out words you already know by using a "MyDictionary" file (the list of words you know)
It saves our time
3. Make a list and show it to you with ability to go over it using mouse or keboard (up/down for scroll and right/left for remove)
4. During removing a word you will automatically add it to the "MyDictionary" file
5. Programm can save state so you can close it and return later
It saves it up several times )))
