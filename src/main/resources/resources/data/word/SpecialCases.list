#Special cases that will not be correctly covered by main 'root' finding process
#Line "from = to" is expected

#This list is for to purposes:
#1. during 'root' finding process it will take root value as 'to' for 'from' (refer SpecialCasesAnalyser.java)
#2. all words from 'from' list (everything before symbol '='), in case several words, will be combined into 1 word
#   divided by single space between them (refer TextSpecialCasesModifier.java)
