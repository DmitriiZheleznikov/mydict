#Prases in lower case are expected, one phrase on one line

#There is ability to point special case, when some idiom/phrase are used in wrong way,
#for example in movie "Back To The Future I" Biff uses phrase "make like a tree and get out of here" with mistake,
#correct version is "make like a tree and leave" and actually they are equal and it would be nice if it would be detected.
#In this case special construction "==" can be used, like this:
#"make like a tree and get out of here == make like a tree and leave"
#program will find first part (before "==") and will use second one (after "==") as a result (examples will be highlighted with first version)
#It also can be used for several version of one idiom, like "easy as ABC == easy as pie"

# 2. pronouns, possessive pronouns, prepositions
#Program equals all these words:
# - my, your, his, her, its, our, their
# - on, in, at
# - i, me, you , he, she, it, they, we
# - mine, yours, hers, ours, theirs
#Following phases are equals:
# - ants in my pants
# - ants at their pants
# - ants on her pants

# 3. skip articles
