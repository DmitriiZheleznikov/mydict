#for example in movie "Back To The Future I" Biff uses phrase "make like a tree and get out of here" with mistake,
#correct version is "make like a tree and leave" and actually they are equal and it would be nice if it would be detected.
#In this case special construction "==" can be used, like this:
#"make like a tree and get out of here == make like a tree and leave"
#program will find first part (before "==") and will use second one (after "==") as a result (examples will be highlighted with first version)
#It also can be used for several version of one idiom, like "easy as ABC == easy as pie"

# 2. pronouns, possessive pronouns, prepositions
